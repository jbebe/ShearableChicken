### Shearable chicken

**Behavior**

Works the same way as sheep, meaning:
* Shear can be used on them
* 2-3 minutes of feather regeneration

**Features**

* Drops 1-3 feathers
* Baby chicken cannot be sheared

**Developer notes**

Shearable chicken replaces the original one so it is more compatible with other mods than using the EntityJoinWorldEvent & spawn combo, like in [earlier works](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pluckable-chickens).
